    <body>
        My name is Colin Connolly. My major is Communication and Rhetorical Studies, and I am double minoring in Marketing and Information Management Technology. I am very interested in marketing and working with colleagues to launch new and innovative marketing campaigns. I would love to work with marketing teams in professional sports organizations or film production companies. I’m a transfer student from the University of Pittsburgh where I studied film production. Upon arriving at Syracuse last fall, I’ve maintained a 3.95 overall GPA and hope to maintain a high GPA for the rest of my time here. I am a co-captain and the social chair of the university’s Club Swim team. Aside from academics and college life, I like to explore new cities finding cool new architecture, artwork, and local places to eat. I also love the outdoors and love to hike and see nature. I am also very interested in photography and videography and hope to do more personal work in those areas!
